# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building a comprehensive security monitoring dashboard system called "MANDLAC-X". The system provides real-time surveillance monitoring with multi-camera feeds, incident detection and tracking, user management, and timeline-based event analysis. The dashboard serves as a centralized command center for security personnel to monitor premises, track incidents, and manage security operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security operator, I want to view live camera feeds in a multi-panel layout, so that I can monitor multiple areas simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display a main camera feed prominently in the center
2. WHEN multiple cameras are available THEN the system SHALL show thumbnail feeds for additional cameras
3. WHEN a user clicks on a thumbnail camera feed THEN the system SHALL switch the main display to that camera
4. WHEN camera feeds are active THEN the system SHALL display camera identifiers (e.g., "Camera - 01")
5. WHEN a camera feed is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error state

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security operator, I want to see real-time incident alerts and notifications, so that I can respond quickly to security threats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an incident is detected THEN the system SHALL display it in the incidents panel with severity indicators
2. WHEN incidents occur THEN the system SHALL categorize them by type (Unauthorized Access, Gun Threat, etc.)
3. WHEN new incidents are detected THEN the system SHALL show the count of unresolved incidents
4. WHEN incidents are resolved THEN the system SHALL update the incident counter accordingly
5. WHEN an incident requires attention THEN the system SHALL provide a "Resolve" action button

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security operator, I want to navigate through recorded footage using a timeline, so that I can review past events and incidents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing recorded footage THEN the system SHALL display a timeline scrubber at the bottom
2. WHEN incidents occur THEN the system SHALL mark their timestamps on the timeline
3. WHEN a user clicks on a timeline marker THEN the system SHALL jump to that specific time
4. WHEN navigating the timeline THEN the system SHALL show playback controls (play, pause, forward, backward)
5. WHEN viewing historical footage THEN the system SHALL display the current timestamp

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want to manage user access and authentication, so that only authorized personnel can access the monitoring system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the system THEN the system SHALL require authentication
2. WHEN authenticated THEN the system SHALL display the user's profile information in the header
3. WHEN users have different roles THEN the system SHALL show appropriate navigation options
4. WHEN a user session expires THEN the system SHALL redirect to login
5. WHEN user permissions change THEN the system SHALL update available features accordingly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security operator, I want to access different sections of the monitoring system, so that I can perform various security management tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display navigation tabs (Dashboard, Cameras, Scenes, Incidents, Users)
2. WHEN a user clicks on a navigation tab THEN the system SHALL switch to that section
3. WHEN on the Dashboard tab THEN the system SHALL show the main monitoring interface
4. WHEN on other tabs THEN the system SHALL display relevant management interfaces
5. WHEN switching between tabs THEN the system SHALL maintain the current session state

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security operator, I want to see a camera list with event indicators, so that I can quickly identify which cameras have detected activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cameras are active THEN the system SHALL display a camera list at the bottom
2. WHEN events occur on specific cameras THEN the system SHALL show colored indicators on the timeline
3. WHEN multiple events happen THEN the system SHALL use different colors for different event types
4. WHEN events are resolved THEN the system SHALL update the visual indicators accordingly
5. WHEN hovering over indicators THEN the system SHALL show event details in tooltips

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security operator, I want the system to automatically detect and classify security events, so that I can prioritize my response based on threat levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing camera feeds THEN the system SHALL automatically detect security events
2. WHEN events are detected THEN the system SHALL classify them by type and severity
3. WHEN high-priority events occur THEN the system SHALL highlight them prominently
4. WHEN events are classified THEN the system SHALL assign appropriate visual indicators
5. WHEN event patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL provide trend analysis

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a security operator, I want to see real-time status information, so that I can understand the current state of the security system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is active THEN it SHALL display current date and time
2. WHEN monitoring multiple locations THEN the system SHALL show location-specific information
3. WHEN system components are offline THEN the system SHALL display appropriate status indicators
4. WHEN data is being processed THEN the system SHALL show processing status
5. WHEN system performance changes THEN the system SHALL update status displays accordingly
